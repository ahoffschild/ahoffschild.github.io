                                    <p>A demo for a future project, created in Unity. A 2D action game with fast
                                        platforming
                                        and faster combat, taking movement and stage cues from games like megaman while
                                        incorporating fighting game inspired attack systems allowing you weave together
                                        flashy combos.
                                        <br><br>Demo has 1 test stage and a boss alongside a basic moveset for the
                                        protagonist - I am looking for release a newer demo in the future with more
                                        original
                                        assets, a complete moveset, and a more polished stage.

                                        programmer. Visual and sound assets were provided by the remainder of the team.
